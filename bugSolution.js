The core problem seems to be related to race conditions or improper handling of asynchronous operations during the camera switch.  The solution improves this by explicitly checking if the camera is recording and handling any potential errors that may arise during the switching process. This utilizes promises to ensure that operations happen in the correct order and provides error handling for failures. 

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';

// ... other imports

export default function App() {
  const [type, setType] = React.useState(CameraType.back);
  const [recording, setRecording] = React.useState(false);

  async function switchCamera(){
    if (recording) {
      try {
        await cameraRef.current.stopRecording();
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error stopping recording: ", error);
      }
    }
    setType(type === CameraType.back ? CameraType.front : CameraType.back);
  }

  // ... rest of the code with error handling and async/await
}
```
